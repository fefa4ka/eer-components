# Servo

The Servo component appears to be used to control the position of a servo motor. The component receives an angle and a speed as input, and uses the Scheduler component to control the servo motor at the desired angle and speed. The Servo component uses the GPIO and Timer components to set the angle of the servo motor by generating PWM signals.
